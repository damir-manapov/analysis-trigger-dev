Analysis of https://trigger.dev/

Goal - to see how the project approaches solving tasks that we also face or if it have some unique approaches/techniqs that we want to be familiar with.

What interests us:
* How pauses and state saved are organized
* How segments are organized
* How the plugin system is organized
* How self-hosting is organized

It seems I mixed up two products here
